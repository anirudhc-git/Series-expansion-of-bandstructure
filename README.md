# Series-expansion-of-bandstructure
Contains Mathematica notebooks that include functions for analysing various aspects of band structures arising from k-space models.
The models could come from k.p theories, wannierisation of DFT data or even simple tight binding models.
In this first version, we include only a notebook containing a function to series expand bandstructures at arbitrary k-points, with the ability to incorporate the effect of changes in some tuning paramaters. A limited class of degenerate bands can be handled by this routine (i.e bands which are assumed to be degenerate at a k point, and have the same Taylor expansion to some desired order).
